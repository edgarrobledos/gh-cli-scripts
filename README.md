## Additional Flag Details

ðŸ”¹ --path:
Useful when you're running the script from outside the repo.
Must point to a valid Git repository (.git folder must exist).

ðŸ”¹ --target-branch:
The branch into which changes will be merged (typically your dev branch).
This should exist on the remote repo and meet any branch protection rules.

ðŸ”¹ --head-branch:
The branch containing the latest changes (typically main or a release branch).
The script uses this as the source of the PR.

ðŸ”¹ --auto-merge:
Automatically merges the PR when all conditions are met (CI, reviews, etc.).
Requires auto-merge to be enabled in the repository settings.
Merge strategy used is --merge (create a merge commit).
